excerpt: Making bases at our September weaving get-together
---

The September get-together was focused on making bases. Julie brought along a huge bundle of semi-dried Leicestershire Dicks, Maia had a semi-dried bundle of a lovely green local unknown variety and Maia had also soaked up some Nana and Green Dicks. Lots of choice for weaving with!  Some people kept honing their skills on round bases, whilst Julie, Bron and Maia had a go at English oval bases using the hand and foot method. Thanks for bringing the instructional video along Julie, that was great fun!

We also unloaded a great pile of coffee sacks at the willow beds, in preparation for mulching the beds again. Thanks Margaret for once again organising for us to pick up sacks from Cerebos-Greggs, and big thanks to Cerebos-Greggs for donating three pallets of sacks to our group. We had four vehicles packed to the gunnels with sacks!
