excerpt: Using formas at our August weaving get-together
---

At the August get-together we used formas to bend rods into rounds and ovals for frame baskets and handles. The formas we used are slabs of wood drilled with a grid of holes to take large removable wooden pegs. Rods of semi-dried willow and hazel were bent and held in place by pegs spaced appropriately on the formas. The pegs are tall enough to bend a number of rods around each shape. The rods now stay on the formas to dry for a couple of months, after which we will have a great stash of bent rods for future basket making!
