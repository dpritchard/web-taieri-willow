We added in an extra work day in the willow beds this month to target the willow aphids. We’ve had quite a big infestation this year, heaviest on the taller varieties at the southern end of the bed, but spreading into the Green Dicks and Nana too. Gretchen and Maia did a staunch job of spraying with Neem oil, while the rest of us worked at the other end of the main bed, weeding and mulching the Nana and Lancashire Dicks. The sacks from Cerebos Gregg are breaking down and forming a very good mulch material. We’re continuing with laying cardboard, then sacks on top to supress the grass. A couple of weeks ago the hedge on the east side was trimmed and chipped, giving us a big pile of chippings to spread as mulch too. The shorter willow varieties, particularly Nana and Lancashire Dicks, were getting very choked and smothered by the tall grasses this year. Its very satisfying to get them looking all happy and beautiful again with the lovely mulch.

Maia also brought along the gorgeous greenwood stool she’s made to show us. Beautiful work Maia!
