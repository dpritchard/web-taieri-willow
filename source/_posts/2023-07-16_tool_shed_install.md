We turned the first sod on the tool shed site on 22<sup>nd</sup> of June, digging holes and ramming in the piles for the shed foundation. We took delivery of the Duratuf Tool Shed kit from Bunnings on 27<sup>th</sup> of June. **Thank you to Bunnings for supporting our project by donating the heavy-duty workbench, security alarm and combination lock for the shed.** Construction of the shed progressed steadily, aiming for completion in time for our annual harvest.

We got the floor down the day before the start of harvest on the 8<sup>th</sup> of July, however we didn’t get the doors on due to a glitch with their size. Nonetheless it was great to have dry storage on site for all our harvest equipment that first wet weekend! The doors were fixed and in place by the second weekend of harvest, and we rapidly filled the now completed shed with even more harvesting paraphernalia.

Assembling the heavy-duty workbench quickly became a priority, and by the end of pack-up on Sunday 16<sup>th</sup> July we had a very tidy shed, with the beginnings of a good storage system. It's fantastic to have this shed at the willow beds – **a huge thankyou to the Waikouaiti Coast Community Board for supporting our group and providing the majority of the funding for the shed purchase!**
