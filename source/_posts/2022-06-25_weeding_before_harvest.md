A great turn out of helpers to do the last tidy of the willow beds before harvest. All the willows have dropped their leaves now, a good indicator that we can go ahead with harvest. Maia and Nicky have done a great job cutting the grass around the outside of the beds, so that we have easy access and good sorting areas for harvest day. The rest of us pulled weeds from around the stools, and started laying a new mulch of sacks between the rows. A big thankyou to Cerebos Greggs for donating bundles of coffee sacks to our group, and to Margaret for organising and picking up the sacks. The sacks are a fantastic weed-supressing mulch.
