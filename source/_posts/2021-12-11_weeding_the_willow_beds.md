excerpt: Great afternoon today weeding the new willow beds.

Great afternoon today weeding the new willow beds. Very encouraging to see great growth on the cuttings and very few weeds coming through our cardboard + coffee sack mulch. A few areas had couch sneaking through where the cardboard layer had gaps, so we did some patching by unpinning and lifting sacks and tucking fresh cardboard underneath. Only 2 dead cuttings out of the 1200+ we planted in September! Looking forward to seeing even more good growth when we have our next weeding day, scheduled for January 29th 2022. See you there!
