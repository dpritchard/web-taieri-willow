Our new name is Coastal Otago Willows and Weavers! 

We have been discussing for some time whether to change our name, now that our willow beds are no longer located on the Taieri Plain and weâ€™re enjoying an ever increasing range of weaving activities. At our AGM on 25<sup>th</sup> September 2023, a list of potential names and a voting method was approved. The list of names was sent to everyone on our gmail list, and voting closed 30<sup>th</sup> September. We think the new name is good, it tells the story of where we are and what we do.
