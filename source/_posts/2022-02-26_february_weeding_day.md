excerpt: A lovely warm day for cutting grass and pulling out weeds.

A lovely warm day for cutting grass and pulling out weeds. The willows are really growing fast, putting on lots of height and leaf. The differences between the varieties are much more obvious now with the different heights, leaf colour and leaf shapes. Very pleasing to see our cardboard+sacks mulch still working well to supress the weeds around the young stools.
