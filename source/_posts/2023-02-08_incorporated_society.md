It’s been a busy summer of not only getting on with mulching and weeding the willow beds, but also lots of fruitful discussion about formalising our group. This is important so that we can get on with raising funds for building a small Tool Shed for our work tools and mulch materials, and then... a larger shed for processing and storing our annual willow harvest! After much debate, discussion with Anna Parker of Matawai Associates, finding out about how other community groups operate and advice from Maia’s solicitor, we decided that becoming an Incorporated Society is the best choice.

On Wednesday the 8th of February 2023 we held a meeting in the Dunningham Suite, Dunedin Public Library, for members to discuss and agree on our process for becoming an Incorporated Society. Twenty members attended the meeting, with apologies from a number of people who were unable to attend. There was unanimous support to go ahead with incorporating, with sub groups set up to get on with preparing the application for incorporation. So now it’s full steam ahead, there’s a lot of mahi to get done, but we hope to be incorporated by April sometime!
