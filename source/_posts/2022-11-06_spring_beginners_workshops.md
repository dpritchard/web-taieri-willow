We ran two beginners workshops this spring, using rods stored from the last few harvests from the Taieri willow beds. We always begin our workshops with a visit to the willow beds and a discussion of what’s involved in growing, harvesting and preparing willow for weaving.

My partner is a skilled metal worker, and we’re incredibly lucky that he recently offered to make a set of bodkins for our group to use at workshops and weaving get togethers. These beautiful bodkins got their first proper workout at the workshops.

Once again the enthusiastic participants worked hard and produced incredibly beautiful baskets!
