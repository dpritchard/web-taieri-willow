excerpt: Thank you to the Waikouaiti Coast Community Board for funding to purchase a Tool Shed.

In February we applied to the Waikouaiti Coast Community Board for funding to purchase a Tool Shed. Bron and Julie attended the Board meeting to speak to our application. The Board were interested in what our group does, and very generously decided to fund us with $2,000 towards purchasing a Duratuf kit set tool shed! Thank you so much to the Waikouaiti Coast Community Board, it's going to make a huge difference to have a shed on site for storing our tools, mulching resources, harvest equipment etc. Last week we finally completed the process of getting a bank account set up to receive the funding. This week we’re getting on with ordering the shed, aiming for a shed raising working bee in mid-June. It’s going to be so good to have the Tool Shed there in time for harvest this year!
