All the warm then wet weather of October and November meant rapid growth of weeds and willows. We decided to fit in an extra day of weeding as well as the usual last Saturday of the month to keep ahead of the weeds and get as much mulching done as possible. A great turnout both days, thankyou everyone! The 12th was a rather hot humid afternoon, and we had to retreat to the shade for afternoon tea!

Maia and Bron had picked up a trailer load of sawdust, and we mixed the sawdust with grass clippings to make a satisfyingly deep mulch over the cardboard+sack mulch layer among the willows.

The willows are looking great after all this work, and itâ€™s obvious we are going to be rewarded with a very good harvest, even though the willows are only in their second year.
