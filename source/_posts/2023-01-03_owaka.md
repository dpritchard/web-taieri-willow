The invitation from Monica and Carla to visit their garden and willow bed in Owaka was taken up by 5 of us on a glorious day in early January. Any excuse to get to the Catlins is tempting and what we saw and heard about was inspiring, if not a little daunting. We marvelled at the vege plot, the nursery, the tunnel house, the fruit and nut trees...not to mention the beginnings of a new willow bed. 

As if the work here wasn't enough, after a  picnic lunch in the garden  we drove the few minutes to the Owaka township. An old church hall has been purchased and already used for community market days and selling fresh produce. As we were shown around our eyes were lighting up at the potential for the use of this space for willow basket workshops.
Buzzing with ideas we needed to calm ourselves with an amble through the cool forest cover of the Pounawea bush walk. That moment when you come out of the forest and onto the inlet beach is stunning.

Thanks so much to Carla, Monica and whanau for your time and generosity. We headed back to Dunedin energised and excited at the prospect of  pooling the considerable knowledge within this group and making baskets in Owaka together.
