Join the end-of-year celebration and last working bee at the willow beds for 2022. Saturday 17th of December 1 – 4 pm. BYO drinks, a plate to share and baskets for show and tell (and a camp chair or picnic rug). 

We’re planning about an hour of work to lift the last of the remaining weedmat and deep mulch that area in preparation for winter planting. Bring gloves and a yard shark or similar tool for cutting long grass. After we’re done mulching it’s put down your tools and put your feet up for our end-of-year afternoon tea party! A good chance to discuss ideas and dates for things we’d like to do in 2023 too.
