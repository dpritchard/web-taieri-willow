## Monthly Working Bees
<x-img src="/assets/img/IMG_20181124_163001906_HDR.jpg" caption="" class="float-right w-1/3 mx-2 my-2"/>

We have regular working bees through the year to look after our willow beds. Working bees are from 1pm to 4pm on the 4<sup>th</sup> Saturday of the month. It’s a great chance to see the yearly cycle of willow growth and learn more about identifying the different species and varieties of willow. Weeding, mulching, and cutting grass are our main working bee activities. Bring gloves and basic weeding tools, drinking water, an afternoon snack and a thermos if you’d like a hot drink.

Next working bee day is on **Saturday 26<sup>th</sup> August 2023, 12 – 4pm**.

We’ll be tidying up after our very successful harvest. All the willow has been cut, but we’ve got a few cultivars that still need their final sort and bundling. Jobs on the day will include sorting, bundling, tying and labelling, completing the inventory of harvest bundles and a general tidy up of the sorting areas. Bring gloves, yard shark (if you have one), warm drink and snacks, and wear warm clothes. If you can bring a wheelbarrow and pitch fork it would be great to start spreading the woodchip mulch in the beds and stay ahead of the spring growth of grass and weeds!

## Annual Harvest

We harvest the willows annually, in the winter when the plants are dormant. Harvest usually happens late June / early July, after all the willows have dropped their leaves, and before the sap begins to move again. Check the website to find out the exact date for the harvest and come along. You can read about previous harvests in [2022][2022] and [2023][2023] on our News Page.

We meet the third Sunday of the month throughout the year to work on weaving projects together. We usually meet at Maia’s place, Seacliff.
