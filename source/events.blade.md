## Monthly Working Bees
<x-img src="/assets/img/IMG_20181124_163001906_HDR.jpg" caption="" class="float-right w-1/3 mx-2 my-2"/>

We have regular working bees through the year to look after our willow beds. Working bees are from 1pm to 4pm on the 4<sup>th</sup> Saturday of the month. It’s a great chance to see the yearly cycle of willow growth and learn more about identifying the different species and varieties of willow. Weeding, mulching, and cutting grass are our main working bee activities. Bring gloves and basic weeding tools, drinking water, an afternoon snack and a thermos if you’d like a hot drink.

Next work day in the willow bed is **Sunday May 28th 12pm-3pm** (note we’ve made weeding day start time a bit earlier than it used to be). Three main jobs planned for this day:

1. On-going weeding and spreading our pile of chipper mulch to prepare for harvest. Bring sharks and gloves. A wheelbarrow and pitch fork would be good for the mulch if anyone can easily bring these. 
2. Clearing the access to the current willow storage area on the neighbour’s property to give safe access during harvest. If you can, bring a rake, wheelbarrow, weed-eater, and / or sacks to help with this job. 
3. Attaching labels with the variety names to the fence at the end of each row, in preparation for harvest. This will be a great chance to get know the names of the varieties and what they look like before their leaves all fall.

## Annual Harvest

<x-img src="/assets/img/IMG_20210626_145245987.jpg" caption="" class="float-right w-1/3 mx-2 my-2"/>

We harvest the willows annually, in the winter when the plants are dormant. Harvest usually happens late June/early July, after all the willows have dropped their leaves, and before the sap begins to move again. Check the website to find out the exact date for the harvest and come along.

The [2022 harvest]({{ url('/news/2022-07-15_annual_harvest/') }}) was on 10<sup>th</sup> of July. [Contact us]({{ url('/contact') }}) to find out more about the next harvest. 

## Weaving Get-Togethers

<x-img src="/assets/img/IMG_20211121_152957753.jpg" caption="" class="float-right w-1/3 mx-2 my-2"/>

We meet the third Sunday of the month throughout the year to work on weaving projects together. We usually meet at Maia’s place, Seacliff.

Next get-together is pine needle coil baskets/string making on **Sunday June 18th 10am - 4pm.** Bring your own lunch. And it doesn’t have to be pine needles – if you’ve got some interesting long thin plant material you’d like to turn into a coil basket, bring it along!
