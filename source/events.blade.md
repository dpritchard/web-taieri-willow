## Monthly Working Bees
<x-img src="/assets/img/IMG_20181124_163001906_HDR.jpg" caption="" class="float-right w-1/3 mx-2 my-2"/>

We have regular working bees through the year to look after our willow beds. Working bees are from 1pm to 4pm on the 4<sup>th</sup> Saturday of the month. It’s a great chance to see the yearly cycle of willow growth and learn more about identifying the different species and varieties of willow. Weeding, mulching, and cutting grass are our main working bee activities. Bring gloves and basic weeding tools, drinking water, an afternoon snack and a thermos if you’d like a hot drink.

Next work day is **Saturday 25 February 1-4pm** to weed and complete mulching the planting area. Bring sharks and gloves.

## Annual Harvest

We harvest the willows annually, in the winter when the plants are dormant. Harvest usually happens late June/early July, after all the willows have dropped their leaves, and before the sap begins to move again. Check the website to find out the exact date for the harvest and come along.

The [2022 harvest]({{ url('/news/2022-07-15_annual_harvest/') }}) was on 10<sup>th</sup> of July. [Contact us]({{ url('/contact') }}) to find out more about the next harvest. 

<!-- 
Bring secateurs, loppers, and gloves. Hot soup and buns are provided for lunch, but to minimise Covid risk, bring your own cold drinks, thermos of coffee or tea, drinking mug and hand towel. Rug up too, its going to be cold!

We meet the third Sunday of the month throughout the year to work on weaving projects together. We usually meet at Maia’s place, Seacliff.

Next get together is Japanese Brushmaking on **Sunday 19 February 10am - 4pm**. Limited to 10 people, bring 30-40 tī kōuka leaves soaked for 2-4 days and wrapped to mellow overnight. Bring your own lunch. A second one will be held later in the year for those that can’t make the first one.
