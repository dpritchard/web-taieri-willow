## Monthly Working Bees
<x-img src="/assets/img/IMG_20181124_163001906_HDR.jpg" caption="" class="float-right w-1/3 mx-2 my-2"/>

We have regular working bees through the year to look after our willow beds. Working bees are from 1 to 4pm on the 4th Saturday of the month. It’s a great chance to see the yearly cycle of willow growth and learn more about identifying the different species and varieties of willow. Weeding, mulching, and cutting grass are our main working bee activities. Bring gloves and basic weeding tools, drinking water, an afternoon snack and a thermos if you’d like a hot drink.

## Annual Harvest

<x-img src="/assets/img/IMG_20210626_145245987.jpg" caption="" class="float-right w-1/3 mx-2 my-2"/>

We harvest the willows annually, in the winter when the plants are dormant. Harvest usually happens late June/early July, after all the willows have dropped their leaves, and before the sap begins to move again. Check the website to find out the exact date for the harvest and come along.

**2022 harvest is happening 10th of July, from 11am**. Bring secateurs, loppers, and gloves. Hot soup and buns are provided for lunch, but to minimise Covid risk, bring your own cold drinks, thermos of coffee or tea, drinking mug and hand towel. Rug up too, its going to be cold!
