## Monthly Working Bees
<x-img src="/assets/img/IMG_20181124_163001906_HDR.jpg" caption="" class="float-right w-1/3 mx-2 my-2"/>

We have regular working bees through the year to look after our willow beds. Working bees are from 1pm to 4pm on the 4<sup>th</sup> Saturday of the month. It’s a great chance to see the yearly cycle of willow growth and learn more about identifying the different species and varieties of willow. Weeding, mulching, and cutting grass are our main working bee activities. Bring gloves and basic weeding tools, drinking water, an afternoon snack and a thermos if you’d like a hot drink.

It's the fourth Saturday of the month this weekend, which means it's a work day! 

**Saturday 24<sup>th</sup> June** 

**12pm - 4pm**

We'll be weeding, mulching, and sorting ties and labels in preparation for the annual harvest. A small group will head to the storage shed to arrange the pallets into bays for storage of our willow harvest, and to clear out our second shed.

Bring food and drink, warm clothes and tools.

## Annual Harvest

<x-img src="/assets/img/IMG_20210626_145245987.jpg" caption="" class="float-right w-1/3 mx-2 my-2"/>

We harvest the willows annually, in the winter when the plants are dormant. Harvest usually happens late June / early July, after all the willows have dropped their leaves, and before the sap begins to move again. Check the website to find out the exact date for the harvest and come along.

Our recent work, along with the dawning of Matariki, brings us to harvest time. This year's harvest dates will be **Saturday and Sunday July 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> 2023**. Please make a note of these dates, we'll be in touch with further info.

## Weaving Get-Togethers

<x-img src="/assets/img/IMG_20211121_152957753.jpg" caption="" class="float-right w-1/3 mx-2 my-2"/>

We meet the third Sunday of the month throughout the year to work on weaving projects together. We usually meet at Maia’s place, Seacliff.

We're having three concurrent workshops at our June get together. Numbers are limited so make your choice and get in quick !

**Sunday 18<sup>th</sup> June**  
**10am - 4pm**  
**Maia's place, Seacliff**  
**BYO lunch**  

Register for your choice of workshop by email to [taieriwillow@gmail.com](mailto:taieriwillow@gmail.com). Please keep in mind that the groups will be kept fairly small (6 in each brush workshop, 8 in the pine needle coil basket). We hope to be able to accommodate everyone, but we're limiting numbers to make sure there's enough tutor time and working space for all :

- **Pine Needle Coil Baskets** (Jill). Make a little coiled basket using pine needles and linen thread ($5 contribution towards materials please)
- **Beginner Tī Kōuka Brush** (Maia). This one is for the folks who missed out last time (BYO pre soaked tī kōuka please - at least 20 of the longest leaves you can find, soaked for 3-4 days prior to the workshop)
- **Intermediate Tī Kōuka Brush** (Julie and Barbara). This workshop requires a bit more preparation: you'll need about 3m of your own hand made, strong, dry string (harakeke or tī kōuka for example), at least 20 of the longest tī kōuka leaves you can find - soaked as soon as possible to be ready by the 18th. Also, a metal nit comb (!) or florists/flower frog if you have either.

Thank you in advance to the tutors who have offered to share their time and skill for our collective benefit. More information will follow once groups have been finalised.

Any questions let Tessa know via email [taieriwillow@gmail.com](mailto:taieriwillow@gmail.com).
