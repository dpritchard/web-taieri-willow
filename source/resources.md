- [Growing willows for basketmaking](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UsbNAAAAMAAJ&pg=GBS.PA6&hl=en_GB). This article published way back in 1855 in the American journal *“The Horticulturist and Journal of Rural Art and Rural Taste”* describes an alternative way of planting new willow cuttings, claimed to achieve a stronger stool and better rod growth. See the article titled *“How to cut willows”* on pages 72 – 74.
