This article published way back in 1855 in the American journal *“The Horticulturist and Journal of Rural Art and Rural Taste”* describes an alternative way of planting new willow cuttings, claimed to achieve a stronger stool and better rod growth. See the article titled *“How to cut willows”* on pages 72 – 74.
