We run basketmaking workshops for beginners in Autumn and Spring of each year. These two-day workshops are usually run over a weekend. We are having two workshops this spring:

- 8<sup>th</sup> - 9<sup>th</sup> October 2022
- 5<sup>th</sup> - 6<sup>th</sup> November 2022

These workshops are almost full already with people on the wait list, but get in contact to find out if there is still a place available and get on the wait list. We sometimes have last minute cancellations, especially in these Covid times, so let us know if you would like to be contacted to take a place at short notice!
