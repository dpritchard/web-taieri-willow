Coastal Otago Willows and Weavers ([formally known as the Friends of the Taieri Willow]({{ url('news/2023-09-30_new_name') }})) is a group of people enthusiastic about growing and using willows for basketry. Our group was formed to:

- Maintain the present and valuable collection of [basket willow genotypes]({{ url('willows') }}) in the South Island of New Zealand;  
- Provide cuttings to NZ basketmakers of these willows to ensure the continuing survival of basket making as a craft;  
- Promote the craft of willow basket making by providing basket willow material for workshops and [running workshops for beginners]({{ url('workshops') }}); and  
- Provide a [working example]({{ url('news') }}) of basket willow cultivation, harvesting and post harvest techniques.
