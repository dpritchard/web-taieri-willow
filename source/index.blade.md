Friends of the Taieri Willow is a group of people enthusiastic about growing and using willows for basketry. Our group was formed to:

- Maintain the present and valuable collection of basket willow genotypes in the South Island of New Zealand  
- Provide cuttings to NZ basketmakers of these willows to ensure the continuing survival of basket making as a craft  
- Promote the craft of willow basket making by providing basket willow material for workshops and running workshops for beginners  
- Provide a working example of basket willow cultivation, harvesting and post harvest techniques
